We are so excited to have Setu in the first edition of 100 Days of Feature Request. This is the offcial repository of brand Setu for 100 Days of Feature Request, where you will be able to submit your Pull Request regarding any new feature as a contribution for the contest.

# About the Brand

Setu is a nutrition company that uses industry-leading science to solve real-life problems. #SupplementsThatMakeSense 

Our approach to nutrition is based on a simple truth: science needs to be practical in order to be effective. All our products are backed by heavy-duty R&D, but that would mean little if they didn't actually help real people solve real problems. Being healthy is hard enough already. Science needs a personal touch. Thatâ€™s why we make supplements that make sense.

- Top Contributors receive **Setu Wellness Kit** (Worth 2500 Rs) and **Echo Dot** with opportunities to get hired for Frontend, Backend & Fullstack Developers.

## Contributing

### Getting Started

To get started with the contribution in the Setu repository, simply fork it into your local GitHub account. Make the changes in the forked repository. In this case, the change will be related to the feature that you will be putting in. You can also clone the repository first, and then fork and push it along with the changes. This will also raise a PR. 

### Submission Guide

To make a submission for the brand Setu in 100 Days of Feature Request, as a first step, fork the repository by clicking the fork button at the right hand corner. In the forked repository, you will be able to make changes and upload your code regarding the feature that you will be making and contributing. 

In the forked repository, create a folder and in that folder, add all the required codes and documents needed for the feature. The folder name should contain your name and the name of the feature which you have built. After naming the folder and later on adding and uploading the contents inside the folder, you will be ready to raise a pull request.

When you are raising a Pull Request, keep in mind to give a proper title of the PR which will be relevant to the changes. In the description section, give a proper description that will tell the summary of the feature request that you have built. Also, you can use markdown in the description that will help you to embed any link or add anything relevant with the description.

### Creating Pull Requests

1. When you're ready to submit your changes, add a descriptive title and comments to summarize the changes made.
2. Select **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**.
3. Check the **Propose file change** button.
4. Scroll down to compare changes with the original document.
5. Select **Create pull request**. 

### Commenting on Pull Requests

Once a pull request is submitted, multiple committers may comment on it and provide edits or suggestions which you can commit directly. You can also add line comments. Take a look at [Commenting on pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) for more details.

### Labelling Pull Requests

A raised Pull Request will be labelled according to the work that has been done in the Pull Request. There are several labels to determine the work that is on-going with the Pull Request. For example, we requested a change in the pull request from the submitter, then the PR will be labelled as *awaiting submitter action*. 

### Reviewing Pull Requests

The Pull Requests will be reviewed on a first come first serve basis. The community and product team of SAWO Labs will be responsible for the reviewing of Pull Requests. Keep in mind that spams will not be tolerated. 

While reviewing the Pull Requests, we may contact the submitter of the PR regarding any changes that need to be made. If the submitter doesn't respond even after making several calls, then we will be forced to close the PR by labelling it as *incomplete*.

Once the review process is complete, the change is either merged into master and pushed immediately or merged into the release branch and pushed in alignment with the release. The branch is then deleted.

## Building and Validating

If you've downloaded the repository and are making a feature on your local machine, you can generate the HTML files from markdown. You can review your changes before you commit them or create pull requests.
